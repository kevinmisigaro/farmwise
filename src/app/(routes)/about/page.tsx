          Farmwise Tanzania (FWT) is tackling the severe decline in smallholder
          farmers by making agriculture more accessible through a &rdquo;farming
          as a service&rdquo; platform, aimed especially at urban dwellers and
          those new to farming. This initiative seeks to counter the effects of
          urban migration and inadequate succession planning which threaten food
          security amid a growing global population. FWT allows individuals to
          invest in agriculture, manage their investments flexibly, and actively
          participate in sustainable farming practices. This approach transforms
          farming into a practical side hustle and financial opportunity,
          promoting a sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.

            Patricia Kakorozya and Ruth Yongolo, founders of Farmwise Tanzania,
            shared a deep concern stemming from a common observation: with each
            visit to their villages, they witnessed the troubling decline in the
            number of smallholder farmers and abandoned farmlands. Coming from
            farming backgrounds themselves and now living in Dar es Salaam.
            Witnessing how city dwellers struggle with financial pressures, they
            felt a personal and urgent call to action. This shared sentiment
            ignited their resolve to find a solution that would reverse the
            trend.
            <br />
            <br />
            Motivated by their own need for additional revenue streams and
            recognizing the broader potential to invigorate the agricultural
            sector, they developed an innovative business model. Their vision
            was to transform farming into an appealing side hustle specifically
            tailored for gainfully employed city dwellers like themselves. By
            making farming accessible and profitable, Farmwise Tanzania aims to
            attract those far removed from traditional agricultural settings,
            thereby ensuring a win-win approach for both platform users and the
            future of farming for future generations.
