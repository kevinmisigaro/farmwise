          Farmwise Tanzania (FWT) is tackling the severe decline in smallholder
          farmers by making agriculture more accessible through a &rdquo;farming as a
          service&rdquo; platform, aimed especially at urban dwellers and those new to
          farming. This initiative seeks to counter the effects of urban
          migration and inadequate succession planning which threaten food
          security amid a growing global population. FWT allows individuals to
          invest in agriculture, manage their investments flexibly, and actively
          participate in sustainable farming practices. This approach transforms
          farming into a practical side hustle and financial opportunity,
          promoting a sustainable and prosperous future for agriculture.
